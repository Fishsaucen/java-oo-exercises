[>store Color data in ArrayList

[>calculating weight by distance: max(center - abs(x), center - abs(y)) * scaleFactor

[>x and y depth should not necessarily equal each other(this may come in handy for the "puzzle filter").
  need some way to determine whether or not they should be the same.

[>can skip over areas outside of bounds(when and OOB area is detected set a variable [one for height,
  one for width] and continue when x or y equals their corresponding value. This value only needs to be
  calculated once, initialize OOB variables to some value that can never be achieved. Only check if they
  match that value. Will also need to continue when x == y(this is our center).
  
[>need an array for the sum of each bit depth value. calculate blur depth with:
  max(center - abs(x)), center - abs(y))
